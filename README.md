# ECET581 - "ROS Programming" course project

The course was finished with a dead Hokuyo Lidar. Reason?
1. LinZ threw the car down to the ground from a 10000 feet tall desk. At that moment the lidar might have broken into a state of eccentric spinning.
2. When we ran the car at low speed, the car's head slightly turn to left that made us thinking of the problem of IMU or making a little angle turning the car slightly to its right.
3. The eccentric spinning may cause the lidar mistakenly recognize the scale of the map later.
